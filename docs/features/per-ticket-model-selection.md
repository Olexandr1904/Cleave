# Feature: Per-Ticket Model Selection via Jira Label

**Status:** Implemented
**Created:** 2026-04-30
**Updated:** 2026-04-30 (dashboard pill added, with backfill for legacy workspaces)
**Author:** Oleksandr Brazhenko

## Description

Every ticket workspace stores the Claude model it should use on `WorkspaceState.model` — the single source of truth for that workspace. The dashboard renders this on each ticket card as a colored pill showing the short name (`haiku` / `opus` / `sonnet`). The model is resolved once at workspace creation: a Jira label (`model-haiku`, `model-opus`, or `model-sonnet`) overrides the global default; absent a label, the global default is snapshotted. Every agent dispatched against the ticket uses this snapshot.

## How to use

1. Add one of these labels to the Jira ticket **before** the pipeline picks it up:
   - `model-haiku`
   - `model-opus`
   - `model-sonnet`
2. The label is consumed at workspace creation. Once the workspace exists, the model is locked in — relabeling the ticket won't affect the running workspace.
3. To switch the model for an existing workspace, delete it and let the pipeline re-create it on the next poll.
4. The chosen model is shown as a colored pill on every ticket card in the dashboard, regardless of whether it came from a label or the global default.

The label prefix is lowercase; the short name is matched case-insensitively (`model-OPUS` works, `MODEL-opus` does not).

## Requirements

- FR1: Recognize labels of the form `model-<short_name>` where short_name is one of `haiku`, `opus`, `sonnet` (case-insensitive on the short name; prefix must be lowercase).
- FR2: At workspace creation, resolve the model and store it on `WorkspaceState.model`. The field is always non-empty after creation.
- FR3: Every agent dispatched against the workspace uses `state.model` directly. No per-agent override; no fallback chain.
- FR4: When a ticket has multiple model labels or an unknown short name, the global default is snapshotted and a Jira comment is posted explaining which label was ignored.
- FR5: The snapshot survives server restarts and mid-pipeline retries via `state.json`.
- FR6: Mid-flight label changes are intentionally ignored — the snapshot is set once at workspace creation.
- FR7: The dashboard renders the snapshotted model as a pill on each ticket card.

## Technical Approach

- `orchestrator/model_resolver.py` — pure function `resolve_ticket_model(labels)` returns `ResolutionResult(model, warning)`. `model` is `None` when the labels don't yield a single valid choice; the caller substitutes the global default.
- `WorkspaceState.model: str` — new dataclass field, persisted via the existing `asdict` serializer.
- `Orchestrator._create_workspace_for_ticket` — calls the resolver, sets `state.model = resolution.model or default_model_provider()`, and posts the warning comment via `JiraAdapter.add_comment` on conflict / unknown.
- `Orchestrator.__init__` takes a `default_model_provider: Callable[[], str]` — the same SQLite-backed reader the LLM adapters use, so the snapshotted default matches what the operator currently has set in the dashboard.
- `AgentRuntime.execute` — reads `workspace.state.model` directly. The agent frontmatter no longer has a `model:` field.
- `dashboard/web.py` — `_scan_all_workspaces` exposes `state.model` so the frontend can render the pill.

## Dependencies

- Jira Integration (`integrations/jira/jira_adapter.py`) — for `add_comment`.
- Workspace Isolation (`workspace/workspace.py`) — for `WorkspaceState` and `state.json` persistence.
- Orchestrator — for the dispatch and workspace-creation flow.
- Dashboard (`dashboard/`) — settings store provides the global default; web layer exposes the snapshot to the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Ticket with `model-opus` → `state.model == "claude-opus-4-7"` and every agent on that ticket dispatches with that model.
- AC2: Ticket with `model-opus` + `model-haiku` → `state.model` is the global default; one Jira comment posted listing both labels.
- AC3: Ticket with `model-llama` → `state.model` is the global default; one Jira comment posted listing the supported labels.
- AC4: Ticket with no `model-*` label → `state.model` is the global default snapshot at creation time.
- AC5: After server restart or mid-pipeline retry, the same model is applied — `state.json` is the durable record.
- AC6: `add_comment` failure does not abort workspace creation.
- AC7: The dashboard ticket card shows a colored pill with the short name (`opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku`) of `state.model`.

## Behavior notes

- Changing the dashboard's global default does **not** affect in-flight tickets. Each workspace keeps the model that was current when it was created. Only new workspaces pick up the new default.
- Per-agent model pinning is no longer supported. The agent frontmatter `model:` field has been removed; the workspace-level snapshot is the single source of truth.
- LLM calls that aren't tied to a workspace (e.g. the Telegram intent parser) continue to read the global default at call time — they're outside this feature's scope.
- Workspaces created before this feature shipped have `state.model == ""`. They still run correctly (the LLM adapter falls back to the global default at dispatch time) and the dashboard backfills the pill display by reading the current global default. The pill on a legacy ticket therefore tracks the *current* global default rather than a frozen snapshot — matches what would actually run on the next dispatch.
